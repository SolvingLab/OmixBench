Description: Provides a comprehensive framework for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) 
    with R programming through intelligent workflow automation. Built on the ReAct 
    (Reasoning and Acting) architecture, 'llmflow' enables seamless bi-directional 
    communication between LLMs and R environments. Key features include automated 
    code generation and execution, intelligent error handling with retry mechanisms, 
    persistent session management, structured JSON output validation, and context-aware 
    conversation management. The package transforms complex LLM interactions into 
    streamlined, reproducible workflows for data analysis, statistical computing, 
    and research automation. Designed for data scientists, researchers, and analysts 
    who want to leverage AI assistance while maintaining full control over their R 
    computational environment.
