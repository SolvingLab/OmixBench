abstract: "OmixBench presents a comprehensive evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs) in multi-omics analysis, systematically assessing 89 contemporary models through 1,002 static assessments and 405 dynamic execution tasks spanning ten omics domains. This work offers an unprecedented and systematic approach to LLM evaluation while revealing pathways toward more equitable access to advanced AI assistance in bioinformatics research."
